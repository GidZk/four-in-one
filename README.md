# Bachelors's Thesis - Four in one
This is a bachelor thesis project made by students at Chalmers univerity of technology and University of Gothenburg.
This game was made in joint with the department of Information technologies and Interaction design.
## Submarine adventure / Ubåtsäventyret
The goal of this project is to design and implement a game where communication and cooperation is encouraged and trained.
The game consists of four tablets put together into one gaming field, the players will interact with a submarine in order to collect valuables.

The players have  control over different mechanisms of the submarine.
* Player 1: Steer the submarine along the **y-axis (UP,DOWN)**
* Player 2: Steer the submarine aling the **-x-axis (LEFT,RIGHT)**
* Player 3: Aim a hook in order to shoot collecatbles.
* Player 4: Trigger shots and reel in the hook.

#### Current status of the project




## Development tools - Unity and Unet
* In this project Unity **v.2018.3.x**.
* Networking API : **Unet High Level API (HLAPI),  Low Level API (LLAPI)**
* **C#** as programming language.

#### Networking information - Unet

In order to connect the tablets we have set up the networking communication with networking API's built inot UNet. Although  **the HLAPI and LLAPI _is-to-be-removed_ in future versions of Unity** so if you want to do further development of this game, the latest version of Unity to use is _2018.4.x_. 
The other option is to rewrite the network communication into the networking API being launched by unity.
